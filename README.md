# hello-world
Just another repository

This is some text to tell you about me. I'm a coder, and for funsies I thought I should do the intro to github little course they have. It tells you to create a hello world repo and then continue on to make a branch, read me, etc. It's pretty decent, especially for people who have never done this before. I, however, have done this so many times. Why am I doing it now? Boredom. 
Thanks for visiting!
